        <h1>MY TRIP TO AARONS TOMB!!!!!!!</h1>
        <p>I was the first Jewish person to go to Aarons Tomb in Jordan in over 50 years.</p>

          <h1><u>Why I went?</u></h1>
          <p>I was enrolled at an ultra orthodox Yeshiva(Rabbinical Seminary) in Jerusalem.<br>
            A large part of the spiritual path I was on was going to Kevarim(Tombs) of biblical figures.<br>
            I had already been to King Davids Tomb, Abraham Issac & Jacobs Tomb, Rachels Tomb, almost every know figure in the bible whose tomb is known.<br>
            I had to set up the trip going into an arab country with no protection, getting a tour guide who knew the desert well, crossing the border from Israel, finding a cab to Petra, multiple 3 hour rides to petra, a 1 hour hike through petra, 3.5 hour donkey ride, and had to climb two mountains. <br>
            I also had to workout a deal with the minister of tourism to meet me in the desert and open the Tomb for me. </p>
